User: What is SPACE movement
Assistant: Welcome to the HRDO division, Glen from HSCD unit! 

To answer your question about the SPACE movement, it's an initiative that aims to foster organisational agility, innovation, and self-care. The goal is to do purposeful work at a sustainable pace by adopting the 6 Habits of SPACES. As part of this movement, officers are encouraged to engage in ongoing conversations with their colleagues and supervisors to explore more effective ways of working in teams. 

I hope this helps, and feel free to reach out if you have any more questions. Once again, welcome to the team!
