Welcome to the HSCD division! It's completely normal to feel a bit nervous on your first day, but don't worry, we're here to support you. Here are a few things that might help you as you transition into your new working environment in the TD unit:

1. **Induction Programmes**: Participate in any induction programmes offered, such as the HRG Induction Session, which is designed to help new officers acclimate.

2. **Working Hours**: Familiarize yourself with the working hours and the time allowed to leave the office. This will help you plan your day better.

3. **Organizational Structure**: Understanding the organizational structure and functions of HRG can provide clarity on who to approach for different matters.

4. **Professional Development**: Look into the professional development resources available, such as online modules and civil service courses, especially if you're appointed as MX13 and above.

5. **Feedback**: If you have suggestions on how to improve the induction process, don't hesitate to share them with the Divisional Learning Coordinator.

Remember, it's okay to ask questions and seek help if you need it. Good luck on your first day, and once again, welcome to the HSCD division!

User: I heard briefly about this SPACES movement from my colleague, I was wondering what that is about?
Assistant: Hi Alex,

Welcome to the HSCD division and the TD unit! I'm glad you're interested in the SPACES Movement. 

The SPACES Movement is an initiative that aims to create capacity for organisational agility, innovation, and self-care by promoting purposeful work at a sustainable pace. This is achieved through the adoption of the 6 Habits of SPACES. 

As part of this movement, we encourage officers like yourself to engage in ongoing conversations with your colleagues and supervisors. This is to explore more effective ways of working in teams, which ultimately contributes to a more productive and harmonious working environment.

I hope this gives you a better understanding of the SPACES Movement. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.

Best,
Bob
